This project is special enough to get a README! I wanted to make a project combining my knowledge of React and Redux for funsies,
and birthed this. I used to host this using `gh-pages`, but 500px has since discontinued their API, and so there was no point that running.
Nevertheless, it was fun making this, and so I took some screenshots before destroying the repo and combining it into this 
mega repository. SO BEHOLD: SCREENSHOTS!
