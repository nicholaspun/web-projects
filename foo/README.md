# Web Projects Mega Repository

I created this mega repository as a way to contain all the projects and mini fiddles 
I've done while playing around with web tools. 

Everything you will see here were separate repositories before. (This took a while to merge together while keeping the commits) 
As such, there may be deployments through `gh-pages` or other means that *no longer work*. I have no plans to re-deploy or maintain
them. I just wanted a central place for all my projects.
