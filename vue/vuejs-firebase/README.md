# vuejs-firebase

> A Vue.js 2 & Firebase project. Followed a great tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we4zuQIXmnw). Also see [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli), a simple CLI scaffolding for Vue.js projects.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
