<h2>About Me!</h2>
<p style="font-size: 20pt;">
  Hi, I'm Nicholas. I'm a 2nd year Computer Science Co-op student at the University of Waterloo. I am a passionate, motivated and hard-working individual interested in the latest trends and technology. In the past, I have been a software developer at D+H,
  and a research assistant in the Physics of Information Lab at the University of Waterloo.

  In my spare time, apart from coding, I enjoy immersing myself in mathematics, and I am currently working hard to obtain a major in Pure Mathematics, alongside Computer Science. My time is also filled with TV shows, comics, board games, and above all else,
  my friends :).
